# LaZagne Credential Dumping Detection Using LimaCharlie 
This project demonstrates how to use LimaCharlie EDR to detect LaZagne

## üéØ Objective 
Detect the execution of LaZagne on an endpoint and respond with alerts using LimaCharlie and Tines.

## üîß Tools Used
- LimaCharlie EDR
- Windows Server VM
- Tines
- Slack
- MITRE ATT&CK (T1003 - OS Credential Dumping)
- LaZagne: https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Detection Rule Logic
Detection is based on:
- File path or name ('LaZagne.exe')
- Comand line usage
- Event type


LimaCharlie D&R Rule:

```
events:
  - NEW_PROCESS
  - EXISTING_PROCESS
op: and
rules:
  - op: is windows
  - op: or
    rules:
      - case sensitive: false
        op: ends with

        value: lazagne.exe
      - case sensitive: false
        op: ends with
        path: event/COMMAND_LINE
        value: all
      - case sensitive: false
        op: contains
        path: event/COMMAND_LINE
        value: lazagne
      - case sensitive: false
